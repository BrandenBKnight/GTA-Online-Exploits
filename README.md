# GTA Online Exploits: Lucky Wheel & Heist Cooldown Bypass

This project leverages AutoHotKey and the GTA Exploits Script to exploit features in GTA Online. Users can enjoy unlimited attempts on the Lucky Wheel and execute heists back-to-back, bypassing the cooldown and eliminating the need for prep missions.

# Description

The project provides two main functionalities: the Lucky Wheel exploit and the Heist Cooldown bypass. The Lucky Wheel exploit uses a macro to sever the internet connection, preventing the game from saving after each spin, thereby allowing for unlimited attempts. The Heist Cooldown bypass exploits a feature that disables game save before and after the heist, enabling you to retain your heist earnings while the game does not register the heist completion. This functionality allows for immediate replay of the heist without cooldowns or the need for preparation missions.

# Prerequisites

Download AutoHotKey [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

Download the GTA Exploits Script

# Usage

# Lucky Wheel Exploit

1. Download and install AutoHotKey.

2. Download the GTA Exploits Script. Save it in an accessible location, like your desktop. Right-click the script and select "Run as Administrator".

3. Open GTA V and load GTA Online. Proceed to an invite-only session.

4. Set GTA V to Windowed Borderless mode: Settings > Graphics > Display Type - Windowed Borderless.

5. Check if AutoHotKey is running by looking for it in your System Tray on your Taskbar.

6. Ensure the script is active by pressing CTRL + F12. You should see the help menu pop up on the top left of your screen. This menu will automatically dissapear after 10 seconds.

7. If you own a Penthouse at the casino, set it as your spawn location and load into another invite only session to spawn there. If not, set your spawn location to 'Last Location', then visit the casino and then exit to save the spawn location.

8. Test if the script will work for your resolution setting by going up to the Lucky Wheel, press E to spin, then Enter to accept the Lucky Wheel's menu prompt. When your game instructs you to press S to spin, press CTRL + F6. A period should appear on your screen. For the script to work, this period must be positioned exactly between the left border and the S in the “press S to spin” dialog. If not, you'll need to configure the code to suit your setup by changing the coordinates listed under "^F6::" in this line "ToolTip, ., 125,50" and keep trying until the period is showing up in the correct position. Each time you alter the code you will need to save and reload the script. Once the period is in the correct position you will need to adjust the coordinates listed under "^F5::" in this line "PixelGetColor, color, 125, 50, RGB". 

9. Return to the casino and press CTRL + F5 to enable the auto spin feature. The script will display “Auto Lucky Wheel Spin is Running”, indicating it's ready. Now, approach the wheel, press E to spin, and Enter to confirm the Lucky Wheel's menu prompt. Don't press anything or move your mouse while the script is active, unless you need to force quit and disconnect as stated in the next step.

10. If the wheel appears like it is about to land on the car, let the wheel come to a stop naturally. If it doesn't, press CTRL + F3 before the wheel stops to disconnect your internet. You need use the hotkey as soon as you can tell that the wheel will not land where you want it to. If you wait too long it will still be spinning very slowly but will still register the result even if you disconnect. If you want to use my failsafe press CTRL + F12 which will kill the GTA process instantly and disconnect your internet then reconnect your internet after 3 seconds. You'll have to start GTA again and start from step 9.

11. Press ESC to pause the game. Select Quit GTA Online from the Online menu to load into the story menu. Once you're in story mode, press CTRL + F4 to disable the network block. Then, load back into an invite-only session. You should spawn in front of the Casino.

12. Repeat steps 9 - 11 until you win the car.

# Heist Cooldown Bypass

1. Load into the heist as normal.

2. Once you have control of your character, press CTRL + F1 to enable 'No Save Mode'.

3. Complete the heist as normal.

4. After the heist concludes and you regain control of your character back in Los Santos, go to Settings > Online and select "Leave GTA Online". This action will disconnect you from GTA Online and load you into Story Mode.

5. Once you have control of your character in Story Mode, press CTRL + F2 to disable 'No Save Mode'.

6. Return to GTA Online. You should have retained all your heist earnings and can commence the heist again immediately, bypassing any cooldown.


# Additional Information

For further assistance, press CTRL + F12 at any time to access the help menu in the script. Remember, despite following these steps, you may still receive texts or calls that typically follow heist completion. These notifications do not mean that heist completion has registered on the server side.
